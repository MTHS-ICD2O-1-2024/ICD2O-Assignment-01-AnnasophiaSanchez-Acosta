    <h2>His contributions</h2>
    <p1>The father of information theory. He introduced the concepts of entropy and Boolean algebra, which are foundational to
    digital computing and communication.<br> His 1948 paper, "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," revolutionized how data
    is encoded, transmitted, and processed.</p1>
